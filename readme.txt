=== THIS PROJECT IS ABANDONED ===

Android 8 disallows any app to draw over notification panel or navigation buttons,
so Pixel Filter cannot work properly on any newer phone, and nothing can be done about that.

Current bugs:

- Add Poisson-disc sampling algorithm for lulz.

- Option to start on battery percentage.

- Fix crashes when watching light level and rotating the phone.

- Diagonal lines on some devices - auto-calibrate bitmap offset using a screenshot.

- Filter does not cover navigation buttons fully when the keyboard is shown.
